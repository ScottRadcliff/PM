# PM: Personal Project Manager

Summary: PM is a software application that allows me to manage the projects I am either involved in, or need to manage. There are other applications available, but they don't seem to do what I want them to.


Features:

* Crud Projects
I want to create projects
So I can manage multiple projects at one time

[] Attributes: name
[] /projects/:id
[] /projects

I want to update projects
So I can adapt to changes in projects

I want to mark projects as complete or incomplete
So I can keep the UI clean


* Crud tasks
I want to create tasks for a project
So I can track work that needs to be done

I want to complete tasks
So I can keep the project current regarding the state of work to be done

I want to delete tasks that are no longer relevant
So I can make sure completed and uncompleted tasks represent the project


* Save files
I want to attach files to a project
So I can keep all project assets in one place


* Reminders
I want to set a reminder that alerts me when things are due
So that I can make sure nothing falls through the cracks
